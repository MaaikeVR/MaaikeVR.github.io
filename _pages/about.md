Hi! :wave:  

I'm {{ site.first_name }}, a 4th year PhD student in the <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">DTAI</a> research group at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/" target="_blank">Jesse Davis</a>. 

My research interests include artificial intelligence, data mining and machine learning, especially when applied to sports. My current research focuses on extracting tactical insights from soccer (event / positional) data using a combination of learning and reasoning techniques. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science with a major in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven in 2019.

Besides computer science, my interests include playing soccer :soccer: :green_heart:, traveling :airplane: :tent:, and all things space-related :rocket:.
